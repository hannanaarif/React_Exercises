Question 1: Deep Prop Drilling for Static Data

/*
    1. Create a new Vite React project.

    2. Create a file named "Child.jsx" that defines a component which:
         - Returns a <p> element.
         - Displays a "message" prop received from its parent.

    3. Create a file named "Parent.jsx" that defines a component which:
         - Returns a <div> element.
         - Renders the Child component.
         - Receives a "message" prop and passes it down to Child.

    4. Create a file named "Grandparent.jsx" that defines a component which:
         - Returns a <div> element.
         - Renders the Parent component.
         - Has a local variable (or state) "message" with the value "Hello from Grandparent!".
         - Passes the "message" prop down to Parent.

    5. Replace the <App /> in main.jsx with the <Grandparent /> component.

    6. Check in your Browser to see if the <p> element in Child displays "Hello from Grandparent!".

    BONUS: What challenges might arise if you need to pass props through many intermediate layers?
*/
Concept Learned:
Understanding the basics of prop drilling and its maintainability issues when data is passed through many levels.

Question 2: Drilling Function Props for Event Handling

/*
    1. Create a new Vite React project.

    2. Create a file named "ChildButton.jsx" that defines a component which:
         - Returns a <button> element with the text "Click Me".
         - Triggers an onClick event using a function passed in via props.

    3. Create a file named "ParentButton.jsx" that defines a component which:
         - Returns a <div> element.
         - Renders ChildButton.
         - Receives an "onClick" function prop and passes it to ChildButton.

    4. Create a file named "GrandparentButton.jsx" that defines a component which:
         - Defines a function called "handleButtonClick" that logs "Button clicked in Grandparent!" to the console.
         - Returns a <div> element.
         - Renders ParentButton, passing "handleButtonClick" as the onClick prop.

    5. Replace the <App /> in main.jsx with the <GrandparentButton /> component.

    6. Check in your Browser: When you click the button, it should log the message to the console.

    BONUS: How might passing functions through multiple layers impact performance or re-rendering, and what can be done to mitigate such issues?
*/
Concept Learned:
Drilling down event handlers while understanding the potential performance pitfalls and discussing strategies for optimization.

Question 3: Prop Drilling with State and Dynamic Updates

/*
    1. Create a new Vite React project.

    2. Create a file named "DisplayCount.jsx" that defines a component which:
         - Returns an <h2> element.
         - Displays the "count" prop received from its parent.

    3. Create a file named "IncrementButton.jsx" that defines a component which:
         - Returns a <button> element labeled "Increment".
         - Calls an "increment" function (passed in via props) when clicked.

    4. Create a file named "CounterContainer.jsx" that defines a component which:
         - Uses the useState hook to maintain a "count" state variable (initially 0).
         - Defines an "increment" function to update the count.
         - Returns a <div> element that renders both DisplayCount and IncrementButton.
         - Passes the current "count" to DisplayCount and the "increment" function to IncrementButton.

    5. Replace the <App /> in main.jsx with the <CounterContainer /> component.

    6. Check in your Browser: Clicking the button should update and display the count.

    BONUS: How do state updates propagate through components, and what effect does prop drilling have on re-renders?
*/
Concept Learned:
Combining state management with prop drilling to dynamically update the UI and understanding the re-render behavior across components.

Question 4: Prop Drilling with Default Props and Prop Validation


/*
    1. Create a new Vite React project.

    2. Create a file named "Greeting.jsx" that defines a component which:
         - Returns a <p> element displaying "Hello, [name]!".
         - Uses a default value "Guest" if the "name" prop is not provided.
         - (Optional) Implements PropTypes to enforce that "name" is a string.

    3. Create a file named "ParentGreeting.jsx" that defines a component which:
         - Returns a <div> element.
         - Renders the Greeting component.
         - Receives a "name" prop and passes it to Greeting.

    4. In your main.jsx file, replace <App /> with two instances of <ParentGreeting />:
         - One with the "name" prop provided (e.g., "Alice").
         - One without the "name" prop.

    5. Check in your Browser to see if Greeting displays "Hello, Alice!" and "Hello, Guest!" appropriately.

    BONUS: What are the benefits of using default props and PropTypes in complex prop drilling scenarios?
*/
Concept Learned:
Implementing default props and type validation to ensure components behave correctly even when certain props are missing.

Question 5: Prop Drilling with Composition Using the Children Prop


/*
    1. Create a new Vite React project.

    2. Create a file named "Container.jsx" that defines a component which:
         - Returns a <div> with specific styling (e.g., a border or padding).
         - Renders any children passed to it using the "children" prop.

    3. Create a file named "Message.jsx" that defines a component which:
         - Returns a <p> element.
         - Displays text passed to it via a "text" prop.

    4. Create a file named "ParentContainer.jsx" that defines a component which:
         - Returns a <div> element.
         - Renders the Container component and passes a Message component as its child.
         - Supplies the Message component with a "text" prop (e.g., "Welcome to the container!").

    5. Replace the <App /> in main.jsx with the <ParentContainer /> component.

    6. Check in your Browser to ensure that Container properly renders the Message component with the provided text.

    BONUS: Compare using the "children" prop for component composition versus passing explicit props. What are the benefits of each approach?
*/

Concept Learned:
Leveraging the "children" prop for flexible component composition and understanding when to use it compared to standard prop drilling.

Each question builds on the previous one, introducing new aspects and challenges of prop drillingâ€”from simple data passing to handling events, dynamic state updates, default values, validation, and composition. This comprehensive progression should give you a robust understanding of prop drilling to excel in your Facebook React interview. Happy coding and best of luck!
