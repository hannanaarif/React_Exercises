*** Here are five more progressively complex useState questions that introduce new concepts and reinforce React state management:


/*
    1. Create a new Vite React Project

    2. Create a ToggleText.jsx file to create a ToggleText
       Component that you export within it.

    3. Inside ToggleText, create an <h1> element and a <button>
       element with the text "Toggle Text".

    4. The <h1> should initially display "Hello, World!".
       When you click the button, the text should toggle between
       "Hello, World!" and "Goodbye, World!".

    5. Import the ToggleText component into main.jsx and replace the
       <App /> with it and test that it works in the Browser.

    BONUS* Can you refactor this so the state is managed with a
           boolean instead of a string?

    2. Create a ColorPicker.jsx file to create a ColorPicker
       Component that you export within it.

    3. Inside ColorPicker, create an <input> element of type "color"
       and a <div> element with some fixed height and width.

    4. The <div> should initially have a background color of black.
       When the user picks a color from the input, update the <div>'s
       background color to match the selected color.

    5. Import the ColorPicker component into main.jsx and replace the
       <App /> with it and test that it works in the Browser.

    BONUS* Can you store the selected color in localStorage so it
           persists even after page refresh?

    2. Create a TodoList.jsx file to create a TodoList
       Component that you export within it.

    3. Inside TodoList, create an <input> element, a <button> with
       the text "Add Task", and an unordered list <ul>.

    4. When the user types in the input and clicks "Add Task",
       the text should be added as a new <li> item in the list.
       Clear the input after adding a task.

    5. Import the TodoList component into main.jsx and replace the
       <App /> with it and test that it works in the Browser.

    BONUS* Can you add a "Remove" button next to each <li> item
           that allows the user to delete individual tasks?

    2. Create a StepCounter.jsx file to create a StepCounter
       Component that you export within it.

    3. Inside StepCounter, create an <h1> that shows the current count,
       a number <input> element (defaulting to 1), and a <button>
       with the text "Increase".

    4. The input should allow the user to enter a step value.
       When the button is clicked, the count should increase by
       the step amount instead of just 1.

    5. Import the StepCounter component into main.jsx and replace the
       <App /> with it and test that it works in the Browser.

    BONUS* Can you make it so that the input value updates state
           only when the user finishes typing instead of every keystroke?

    2. Create a ShoppingCart.jsx file to create a ShoppingCart
       Component that you export within it.

    3. Inside ShoppingCart, create three buttons labeled "Add Apple",
       "Add Banana", and "Add Orange". Also, create a list <ul> element.

    4. When you click a button, the corresponding fruit should be
       added to the list. If a fruit is already in the list, increase
       its quantity instead of adding a duplicate.

    5. Display each item as "Apple x2" if multiple of the same fruit
       are added.

    6. Import the ShoppingCart component into main.jsx and replace the
       <App /> with it and test that it works in the Browser.

    BONUS* Can you add a "Remove" button next to each item that allows
           the user to decrease the quantity or remove it completely?
