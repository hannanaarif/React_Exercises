    1. Create a reducer.js file and create a function
       called 'reducer' that has 2 parameters:
       1. state
       2. action

    2. Make this code work:
       const res = [1, 2, 3].reduce(reducer);
       console.log(res); // This should log: 6

    3. Use node in your terminal to run the file to
       test this: node reducer.js
